    "Studying at a university is a significant milestone. It is the so-called \"right of passage\" for anyone who seeks academic excellence. It is well known that attending an international university is costly and requires careful planning. Unfortunately, still, many students get themselves in huge debt that ultimately takes them years to pay off. Thus, saving every dollar, when they can, wherever they can, will prove to be beneficial in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students often face the dilemma between affordability and accessibility - to either spend thousands on a room that is very close to their university or a cheaper place but is a distance away. The expected return (cost/km) has to be within one's level of acceptance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Student residences/dormitories offered by Universities are by far the best options, as they are conveniently located on or near their campus but are also one of or if not, the most expensive options available. (Costing on average of SG$14,000 per school year!)\n",
